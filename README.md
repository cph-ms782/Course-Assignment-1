This project consists of an index page and a groupContract page.

The index page starts out with a table of our group members that can be sorted by clicking the tables heads. It also has buttons that changes the content of the page, a button that changes it to content relating to jokes and a button that changes it to content ralating to cars, aswell as a button that gets you back to the group content.

On the Joke page you get a table of all the jokes and you can get a joke by id or get a random joke.
On the car page you first get a table with all the cars, you can then get smaller samples of the table my searching for cars made before or after a certain year, cars made by a specific company and cars that costs more or less than a certain price. You can also sort the table by clicking the table headers.

The groupContract page contains our group contract aswell as addtional information about each group member and what they contributed during the project.
